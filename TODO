- update and project
- what everyone is doing
- eva on cluster

**say that I will not be here next week


How to improve model:
increase "max_epochs" variable
convert dicom files to nifti files
must use .nii.gz files
change USE_REAL_DATA variable to True
place path of real data in REAL_DATA_PATH variable
it will train in 50 epochs
I have an updated script for number of gpu's on my pc, but the cluster is not updated

Future:
have num gpus be defined as a parameter
have real data boolean defined as parameter
have path to real data defined as parameter
